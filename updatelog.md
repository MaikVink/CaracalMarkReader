**Update to V3.0**

fixed problem where it could not read an empty line at the start of the document.

prevent the system to read marks below a 5.5. This makes the data more concise to read when some teacher only submit marks that are 5.5 or higher (and otherwise would set their grades to NVD).

reordered the output, making it easier to use/read.

**small Update (still V3.0)**

remove personal data in the caracalReader.

Added extra explanation what to do with line 16.

update the readme, so it also includes some small legal protection.
