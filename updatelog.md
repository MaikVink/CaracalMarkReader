**Update to V3.0**

fixed problem where it could not read an empty line at the start of the document

prevent the system to read marks below a 5.5. This makes the data more concise to read when some teacher only submit marks that are 5.5 or higher (and otherwise would set their grades to NVD)

reordered the output, making it easier to use/read
